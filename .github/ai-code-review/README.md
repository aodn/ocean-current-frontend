# AI code review

Advisory AI code review for pull requests. It uses the shared workflow in
[`aodn/common-workflow`](https://github.com/aodn/common-workflow/tree/main/ai-code-review).
The scripts, tests, security notes and the Kiro engine are all documented there.
This repository only holds its configuration.

Both files are read from the PR head, so a PR that edits them is reviewed
with its own version. The shared workflow adds the sandbox description,
untrusted-content rules and output format around them.

## Behaviour

- Runs on PRs to `main` when opened, pushed, reopened or marked ready. Drafts,
  PRs labelled `skip-ai-review` and **PRs from forks** are skipped. A new push
  cancels the in-flight review.
- **No credential** (Dependabot, or secret not set): a "skipped" comment.
  Maintainers can run it manually from _Actions → AI code review (Kiro) → Run
  workflow_ with the PR number. The shared workflow still skips fork PRs on
  manual runs.
- Errors or timeouts: a comment links to the run. The check stays green.

## Configuration

- `KIRO_API_KEY` **secret**: a Kiro API key (needs Kiro Pro or higher).
- `KIRO_MODEL` **variable** (optional): model id. Unset uses the account default.
- **Version**: the caller uses the floating `ai-code-review-v1` tag, so each
  compatible release of the shared workflow is picked up automatically.
