      'Late last year we took note of the persistent upwelling along the Bonney Coast. Indeed, the ocean conditions led to a phytoplankton bloom, evident in our maps of ocean colour (Figure 1) and in true colour imagery available via the IMOS Satellite Remote Sensing facility (Figure 2). ',

    content:
      "Great news for anyone interested in ocean currents: SWOT data is now available, and is much better than expected! SWOT is a new type of satellite altimeter. Instead of just measuring sea level directly below the satellite along a narrow track, it measures sea level out to the side as well. Not nearly as far as a scanning radiometer does (e.g. to measure sea surface temperature) but wide enough to give, for the first time ever, a snapshot view of sea level as a 2-D field. Let's look at some ocean data near Sydney, where the flows are often strong, the skies are often clear and there are 3 IMOS Acoustic Doppler Current Meters.",

    content:
      "We have exceptional ocean conditions for this year' race, as far as favourable currents are concerned, thanks to the combined effect of four warm-core (anti-clockwise rotating) eddies and one cold-core (clockwise) eddy. Indeed, of the past 30 years, this appears to be the one when ocean currents most need to be taken into account by competitors (in addition to wind and waves) when choosing a course. \n The first warm-core eddy is centered NE of Sydney and will only potentially affect yachts (positively) as far south as Jervis Bay. The second warm eddy is off southern NSW and will also potentially provide a boost, all the way to the border.",
